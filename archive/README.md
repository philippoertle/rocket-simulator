### `pet_rocket_ai_spec.md`
Original specification document that initiated the project.

This was the initial AI-assisted specification that outlined:
- Project goals and scope
- Safety considerations
- Technical requirements
- Physics modeling approach
- Development methodology

**Note:** This is a historical artifact. Current requirements and design are documented in:
- `README.md` (overview)
- `docs/development/PROJECT-PLAN-12207.md` (formal requirements)
- Source code documentation (implementation details)

## Purpose

This directory preserves artifacts from the development process that are:
- Important for historical reference
- Not needed for day-to-day use
- Superseded by updated documentation
- Valuable for understanding project evolution
